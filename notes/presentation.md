# presentation

## Intro - Ash
	Welcome, I would like to introduce you to team Tertius (ter-shush), Theres Dave Dye, Ionut Cojocaru, Muhammad Ahsan and myself Ash Farrar. And we are here to show you what we have been working on for the past 7 days.

## Project Overview - Ash

### notes
problem 
- we needed to intergrate a react app front-end, a java API backend into a cloud based solution
- migrate from an in memory h2 database to a postgres cloud database.
- create a CI/CD pipeline for the project

		I will now pass you onto Muhammad to discuss our Tech Stack.

## Demo - Muhammad
	Thanks Ash.  

*Demo build pipeline / front-end usage*

	I will now pass you onto Ionut to discuss our Tech Stack.

## Tech Stack - Ionut
	Thanks Muhammad. 

	For the infrastructure of our project we chose to use Amazon Web Services or AWS, due to the multitude of infrastructure tools available in AWS and its prevelance in the industry.

	We chose postgres for our database, as it was a good fit for the requrements of the project.

	I will now pass you onto Dave to discuss our working practises.

#### notes
- AWS
- kubernetes
- rds, postgres


## working practises - Dave
	Thoughout the projedct we employed agile working practises, this allowed us to qucikly address bottlenecks, both in terms of our work flow and programmatically.  

#### notes

admin tools 
- kanban board - trello
- calendar - google calendar
- slack huddle, stand up 
- slack huddle, afternoon review

	During the morning stand up meeting as a team we would review and update our kanban board on trello. This allowed us to collaboratively iterate on our project, focusing on our MVP while setting streach goals of additional desired features.

collabrative tools
- github - code
- hasicorp cloud - terraform state
- docker hub - container images
- AWS IAM users - VPC
- google live docs for notes and presentation tools

agile methodologies
- tdd
- pair programming
- mob programming solutions

## Problems and Challenges - Ash
	We had a time constraint of 7 working days, which we addressed by prioriting a core feature complete MVP

	As both the provided front-end and back-end applications of the project were initally unknown to us, this created difficulty predicting the challenges we would face and the infrastructure requirements of the applications. We addressed this by implimenting a robust research and documentation phase before beggining work

#### notes
- remote working

## Finally - Ash

On behalf of everyone on Team Tertius, we would like to give a huge thank you to everyone for taking the time to watch our presentation and we hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed working on this project. 
Thank you.
